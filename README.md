## âš¡ Intro
So I took a Coursera Python course and wanted to have some fun with it,\
right around that time I discovered the whole idea of web scraping.\
We all know that knoledge is everything nowdays, so creating my own\
web scraper was only a manner of time.



## ðŸ›  The program 
Basically extracts all the statistics of every game that has been played\
in the English football league and return a csv file containing all of that data.

Having that data in a csv file let you tap in to a great feature in Excel\
called Pivot tables that gives an easy way to view and learn from this data.
